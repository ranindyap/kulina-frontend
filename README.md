Test for kulina internship
This is my submission for the internship test.
I focus on the desktop page, so I apologize if the mobile version is a little bit messy.
This is my first web page that actually made it.
The files:
index.html --> source code html for the page
style -> style.css --> file to style the page
images -> all images I use to develop the web page

Thank you and
Wish me luck
